# Day Planner 

## Description:

Simple day planner that allows the user to save events for each hour of the standard workday (9 AM - 5 PM). 

## How it works: 
When the user opens the day planer the current date is displayed at the top of the page.

When the user scrolls down they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. If the user clicks into a time block they can enter an event.

Subsequently, if the user hits the save button next to the event that event is then saved to local storage.

Saved event(s) will persist even if the page is refreshed.
